I'm busy these days, mods update may not be that fast.

# 3.4.0
### Bugfix
- Globed compatible, to chroma remote players is a bit crash risky so I don't dare to make it optional for now  
- Chroma Speed is now optional to sync timewarp value or ignore timewarp (sync real world clock)  

# 3.3.2
Ghost Trail chroma supports mac now (again thanks to @hiimjustin000)  

# 3.3.1
Add warning page sprite image (I miss that)  
Some text polish  
  
# 3.3.0
Hoping this release will never crash our geometry dash, best wishes
### Addition
- Ghost Trail chroma (except mac for now)
- Ghost trail generator rewrite fix (optional) (except mac for now)
- Some perhaps useful options
### Bugfix
- Better UI text, to make the mod menu more user-friendly
- in-game playing more safe (I hope)
- Warning Page rebuilt (avoid possible crash)
### ToDo
- More Color pick options
- More chroma pattern options (chromatic phase, brightness, ...)

Finally new project worths being submitted to Geode index...
### Additions
- White sprite chroma;
- Spider Teleport Line returns (except mac);
- Spider teleport line position align fix;
- Separately config effect chroma patterns for different gamemode icons (advanced mode only)
### Bugfix
- Separate Dual Icons perfectly compatible;

# 3.2.0-alpha.2
### Additions
- Chroma Engine constructed, now it should really chroma your icons;
- Menu Preview: preview effect in mod menu (it's optional);
### Bugfix
- Fix crash without More Icons installed, this bug is so stupid;
- Fix display issue of frames in mod menu ~~(by adding Happy Textures as required dependency)~~
- Optimized mod menu, more effects and more stable;
- Optimized codes.

# 3.2.0-alpha.1
Man! What can I say?
### Notice
- Windows Only
- This is only a pre-release of menu UI design, this release will no sense chroma your icons in-game
- This is not final UI conclusion. Will probably polish it later
- May perhaps crash your game despite max effort taken to avoid such tragedy. Personally suggest relaunch your game and save your game data before flirting with current menu

#### Legacy Chroma Icons Below
# 2.2.0
Besides Geode 4.x port, there are also:
### New element
Chroma Dash fire, even spider teleport line if you want!
### UI Redesign
#### Easy mode
Added Easy mode for most cases we don't expect seperate colors for icon status (works just like the old Apply to Common)
#### More Animation
Integrate the icon select menu and the config menu with more Animation. Hoping them look better
#### Self Made Effect Icons
Wave Trail, Particles, dash fire,...
#### Chroma State Preview
Preview your chromatic Icons directly in setup Menu!
### Bugfix
Confirmed everywhere works properly before release

# 1.1.0
### Bugfix
#### 1.Fix Robot/Spider Glow Not Working Bug!
How stupid can it be to chroma dynamic icons?
#### 2.Fix some visual bugs
~~I removed the title image of about.md~~  
I fixed the issue that the title image of about.md displays unproperly in Medium Quality mobiles.
### New stuffs
#### 1.Chromatic icons in editor playtest!
Considering capability issues, applying to editor playtest is optional, you can disable it individually.
#### 2.Phase options!
- For now you can decide your secondary&glow color align with main color (keep the same) or keep a constant phase distance (keep different)  
- Also able to decide Player 2 color phase aligns with Player 1 or not
#### 3.One-time Pointercrate Submission Notify
Only take effects in the first time you enter the mod menu in playing an extreme demon (Yes I have to do this)
#### 4.Copy & Paste Color in Static/Gradient Menu
Copy a color and quick paste it somewhere else!
#### 5.Some Visual Updates to options menu
ScrollLayer option menu
Description button of the *Apply to Common* option (in case some guys don't understand what does this option do)
Switch Option Color (simple and cool)
### To Do
- More than 2 colors gradient
- Set an icon effect set for single level
- Flash pulse
- Quick Settings
- Main Menu Effect Preview (perhaps?)
- Pick color from Robtop's official color set
