# <cy>Chroma Icons</c>
Reanimation of legacy Chroma Icons for GD 2.204 @ geode 2.x!  
Besides original functions, this mod also has:  
#### <cy>New Intergrated Mod Menu</c>
Enjoy your mod config and preview them in a new designed integrated mysterious menu!
#### <cy>Set different colors for Gamemodes</c>
Set them together in <cb>Easy-Mode</c>, or customize various gamemode icons individually in <cr>Advanced-Mode</c>!  
Switch <cb>Easy</c> / <cr>Advanced</c> mode in bottom left corner of main menu.
#### <cy>Optional Vehicle Riders</c>
Set cube riders' colors follow their ship / ufo / jetpack vehicles' chroma pattern or remain the cube's own colors;
#### <cy>Mods Compatible</c>
Max effort made to make this mod compatible with other icon modifying modes, such as **Separate Dual Icons** (Weebify) and **More Icons** (hiimjustin000).
#### <cy>Ultimate Trigger</c>
Toggle <cg>ON</c> / <cr>OFF</c> the whole mod anytime you want!  

## <cr>WARNING</c>
Regarding Pointercrate and some other Lists' policy for Mega Hack v7's Icon Effects, when setting your player icons variable in playing a list level, some chroma patterns may really <cy>**Violate guidelines**</c> and result in your submission getting <cr>**REJECTED**</c>. This mod will NEVER take responsibility for your ignoring this.  

### <cy>Also Note that:</c>
- Despite effort made on compatibility, This mod may very probably conflict with other related Icon Color modifier mods (e.g. Same Dual Color). I'm not willing to set them conflict to force you pick one, But you can take a try yourself, also you can contact me to look into your conflict mods;
- Spider Teleport Line modifying is yet not supported on Mac ~~cuz PlayerObject::onSpiderJump(bool) is not implemented for Mac yet~~  

## <cy>How to use this mod?</c>
This mod adds its menu entrance button to:
- **Icon Select Menu**
- **Pause Menu**
- **Level Editor Page** (if option "Editor Test" ON)  
so you can access the mod menu either in game menu or in playing a level.  
#### Note that:  
- Whenever you change any chroma pattern (e.g. in a paused level), your setup / option changes will take effect immediately (e.g. once you resume to play).
- For detailed manual, see you in **[ReadMe](https://github.com/Naxrin/Chroma-Icons-Reanimation)** in Github repo. I try my best to describle this mod's base logic there.  

## <cy>Claim</c>
