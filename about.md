## <cr>WARNING</c>
- Despite most effort on stability, Old versions of this mod may perhaps randomly crash your game in playing a level, and I cannot promise this update has completely fixed it. Take it in mind if you are challenging your new hardest level or something matters your life. **As far as I know, no more in-level crash is reported since 3.4.0 update.**
  
- Regarding Pointercrate and some other Lists' policy for Icon Effects of Mega Hack , when setting your player icons variable in playing a list level, some chroma patterns may really <cy>**Violate guidelines**</c> and result in your submission getting <cr>**REJECTED**</c>. This mod will NEVER take responsibility for your ignoring this.
  
- Despite effort made on compatibility, This mod may very probably conflict with other related Icon Color modifier mods (e.g. Same Dual Color). I'm not willing to set them conflict to force you pick one, so you can take the attempt yourself (most times they won't crash the game), also you can contact me to look into your conflict mods.

## <cy>How to use this mod?</c>
This mod adds its menu entrance button to:
- **Icon Select Menu**
- **Pause Menu** (unless option "Pause Menu Entry" OFF)
- **Level Editor Page** (if option "Editor Test" ON)  
You can access the mod menu either in garage menu or in playing a level.  
#### Note that:  
- Whenever you change any chroma pattern (e.g. in a paused level), your setup / option changes will take effect immediately (e.g. once you resume to play).
- For detailed manual, see you in **[ReadMe](https://github.com/Naxrin/Chroma-Icons-Reanimation)** in Github repo. I try my best to describle this mod's base logic there.
