# <cy>Chroma Icons Reanimation Project</c>
So as you can see, former [Chroma Icons](https://github.com/Naxrin/Chroma-Icons) is gonna return.
In this new repo, I rewrite almost the whole mod, not only the menu but probably also the chroma logic later.

### <cy>Claim</c>
All stuff related to blur background in this mod are copy from TheSillyDoggo's [Blur BG](https://github.com/TheSillyDoggo/Blur-BG)  
Will pull request soon and set that as dependency if Blur BG is added to index later.
