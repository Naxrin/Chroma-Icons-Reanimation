# <center><font face="Bold">Chroma Icons Reanimate Project</font></center>
So as you can see, former [Chroma Icons](https://github.com/Naxrin/Chroma-Icons) is gonna return.
In this new project, I rewrite almost the whole mod, not only the menu, but also the chroma engine.

Besides 2.2 port of **Mega Hack Icon Effect**, this mod aims to provide a complete solution to your expect on your player related things.
### <font color = "yellow">Intergrated UI</font>
Enjoy your mod config in new designed integrated mysterious menu;
### <font color = "yellow">Set different colors for Gamemodes</font>
Set them together in easy-mode, or customize various gamemode icons individually in advanced-mode!  
Switch Easy / Advanced mode by clicking the (toggler) button at the bottom left corner of main menu.
### <font color = "yellow">Seperate Riders</font>
Optional to set cube riders' color follow their ship/ufo vehicles or the cube's own color;
### <font color = "yellow">Ultimate Trigger</font>
Toggle ON/OFF the whole mod without having to relaunch your game!

## <font color = "red">Warning:</font>
Regarding Pointercrate List Team's policy for Mega Hack v7's Icon Effects, some behaviors related with this mod, such as editing Icon Effects in playing a demon list level, is probably <font color = "red">**Not Allowed**</font> for record submission.  

### <font color = "yellow">Also Note that:</font>
Despite max effort made on compatibility, This mod may very probably conflict with other related Icon Color modifier mods (e.g. Same Dual Color). I'm not willing to set them conflict to force you pick one, But you can take a try yourself;

## <font color = "yellow">How to use this mod?</font>
This mod adds its menu entrance button to **Icon Select Menu** *(GJGarageLayer)* , **Pause Menu** *(PauseLayer)*, and also **Level Editor Page** *(LevelEditorLayer)* if the option is toggled on, so you can access the mod menu either in game menu or in playing a level.  
If you change any chroma pattern in a paused level, this mod will take effect once you return to play.
### <font color = "yellow">Home Page</font>
Here you can preview how this mod affects your icons. Once you hope to edit the chroma patterns of any gamemode icon / effect, just click it and enter the Setup Page.  
Besides gamemode icons, there are also five in-game effect buttons below icons menu, they stand for Regular Trail, Wave Trail, Dash Fire, Teleport Line (not working for now), and your UFO shell. New chroma icons allow you to chrome those in-game icon effect.  
#### <font color = "yellow">Player Switch</font>
click the player 1 / Player 2 text label (yes this is a button), you will switch between modifying chroma patterns of your main player or dual player 2.
#### <font color = "yellow">Easy / Advanced Mode</font>
Comparing legacy Chroma Icons for 2.204, his mod introduce **Easy Mode** and **Advanced Mode** instead of "Apply to Common" in legacy mode.  
You can switch between modes by clicking the demon face button at left bottom.  
If the Preview Effect option is off, button items will display default-like (just like those inside your profile page),
##### <font color = "yellow">Easy Mode</font>
For most cases, we just hope to setup chroma pattern regardless of current icon gamemodes (ship/wave/..), then we set the mod to **Easy Mode**.  
Easy mode still allows you edit in-game effects.  
##### <font color = "yellow">Advanced Mode</font>
Advanced Mode allows you customize chroma patterns seperately between gamemodes.  
#### <font color = "yellow">Speed Slider</font>
Set the chroma cycle speed by dragging the slider or editing the text input or clicking the two arrows. Your changes take effect once you released the slider thumb, finished input or arrow clicked.  
The unit of the speed value you see in menu is Hertz, that means your icons chroma in a period time of 1/speed if speed > 0 and stay constant otherwise.  

### <font color = "yellow">Setup Page</font>
Here you can customize your chroma pattern of current selected player icon / in-game effect.  
Once you leave the page or switch to another item / channel, current config are saved immediately.  
#### <font color = "yellow">Switch Items and Channels inside setup page</font>
The cells in the left are actually in a scroll layer, you can pick another player icon / in-game effect by clicking the item button inside the cell.  
If the selected item is a gamemode icon, you can click the left / right arrows to switch the channel (Main / Second / Glow) you are working on.
All your changes take effect real-time on the button preview of current selected scroll layer cell. As for unselected others, they appear as not previewed.  
#### <font color = "yellow">Modify Your Chroma Pattern</font>
New Chroma Icons introduces five chroma modes for you.
Choose a mode in setup workspace, then the mod will expand sub options of this option.
##### <font color = "yellow">Default</font>
Just set the icon channel / effect to its original color as if this mod is not loaded here.
##### <font color = "yellow">Static</font>
As it says inside mod menu, pick a color and then this icon channel / effect just keeps painted this color constant.
##### <font color = "yellow">Chromatic</font>
Let the icon channel / effect chroma HSV cyclic (cycle hue value)  as Mega Hack formerly does.  
The saturation slider below works just as it says. For instance, set to 100 if you expect RGB chroma or set to 50 if you expect Pastel chroma.  
##### <font color = "yellow">Gradient</font>
Let the icon channel / effect gradient between your picked two colors. The gradient pattern is shown as follows.
##### <font color = "yellow">Progress</font>
Let the icon channel / effect gradient from a color to another regarding your current level percentage in game.
The best option is planned to set the percentage fixed to your progress of the level you are running, but this doesn't work for now.
#### <font color = "yellow">Copy / Paste</font>
A Copy button and a Paste Button lay under the options button. You can copy your current chroma setup and paste your mode select and all their sub options elsewhere.  
### <font color = "yellow">Color Page</font>
When a color option frame clicked, the color page pops out, and you can pick the color here.
#### <font color = "yellow">Edit Color</font>
Drag the color picker, or drag the RGB sliders, or edit the RGB / Hex inputs.
#### <font color = "yellow">Copy / Paste / Recover</font>
Just as Geode's color pick popup, the color page shows the original color and current color for you. But in Addition here, both of them are buttons, they pop up their Copy / Paste and Copy / Recover buttons. You know what to do.  
### <font color = "yellow">Options Page</font>
The gear button at the top right enters options menu on click, There are some mod options for you.
#### <font color = "yellow">Switch</font>
Toggle ON/OFF the mod.  
If the mod is toggled OFF, it will no sense chroma your icons in playing, all other options will effect nothing. items in home page and setup page will display gray-white regardless the Preview Effect option.
### <font color = "yellow">General Options</font>
I don't know how to group them.
### <font color = "yellow">Phase Options</font>
I don't know how to group them.
### <font color = "yellow">Menu Options</font>
Customize options for the mod menu.
### <font color = "yellow">Info Page</font>

Paerhaps will integrate mod manual, but I'm terribly lazy :/
